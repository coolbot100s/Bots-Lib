## Bot's Lib  

"*A Required Dependancy*" - some mod, probably.  

A library mod to keep me from re-writting things over and over again, mostly existing because I don't know what I'm doing.  
Contains a couple simple functions that other mods use.
Right now primarily a special raycast function, some RNG stuff and some things to make interacting with farmland faster.
Also contains the block tags related to the Dew Drop project, which is probably a bad way of going about things, but it's simpler for me this way.  

Check out one the mods that depend on this library, like [Dew Drop Watering Cans](https://modrinth.com/project/Jal3lwVg).
